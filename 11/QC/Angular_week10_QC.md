# QC Questions on Angular
 - What is Angular?
   - Typescript based single page application UI framework, developed by Google, used to create dynamic web applications.
 - What are some differences between Angular and AngularJS?
   - Angular 2+ is TypeScript based, while original flavor is JavaScript based.
   - Angular 2+ is component based, while Angular is MVC based
   - Angular 2+ supports mobile devices better
 - What version of Angular are you comfortable working with?
   - Angular 2 was a major overhaul of the technology, and angular 4+ continues right up to version 13 which is current. We have been using the newest version of Angular, 13.
 - What is the latest released version of Angular?
   - Angular v15 
 - What is the Angular CLI?
   - The command line interface that helps us create, configure, and initialize our Angular apps, modules, and components.
 - How can you create a new Angular project on the command line using the Angular CLI?
   - ng new <name>
 - How can you create a new component on the command line using the Angular CLI?
   - ng generate component <component-name>
   - or shorthand: ng g c <component-name>
 - What are components?
   - A component is a special type of directive, and is a class that contains data and logic for our view. Sometimes the word component is used to refer to the entire view, which is made up of the template, component, and styles (also unit test file). However, technically, the component is just the class decorated with the @Component decorator in the name.component.ts file. Components are the building blocks of Angular apps, and can be as big as a whole page, or as small as a single button or field.
   - Views are made up of 4 files created by the CLI: (but sometimes you may hear people refer to a view as a component.)
     - template/view in the .html file
     - Stylesheet in the .css file
     - component in the .ts
     - unit tests in the .spec.ts file
 - What is an Angular module?
   - Angular modules contain metadata about one or more components, and are used to describe how the components should be built and injected. The module exposes and makes public components, pipes, directives, etc. And the module can import those things exported by other modules.
   - Angular is built to be modular, and a module is a container dedicated to a domain, workflow, or closely related set of features.
 - What is a directive?
   - A class that is used as a marker/attribute on a DOM element that allows us to manipulate the DOM.
 - What are examples of structural directives?
   - \*ngIf, \*ngFor, \*ngSwitch - note these all begin with a \*.
 - What are examples of attribute directives?
   - [ngClass], [ngStyle] - note that these are surrounded by []
 - Is a component considered a directive? Why or why not?
   - Yes, a component is a special type of directive. The `@Directive` and `@Component` decorators are used to mark classes. `@Component` extends `@Directive`, and marks a class as a special type of directive used to create views in the DOM.
 - What are the different types of data binding supported by Angular?
   - one-way data binding: String interpolation, Property binding, event binding
   - two-way data binding: a mix of property binding and event binding.
 - What is interpolation? Is it different than property binding?
   - interpolation is where we inline the value of a string from our component into our template/view using {{ string }} syntax. This is different from property binding. Property binding can be used with non-strings.
 - What is event binding? Describe the syntax
   - Allows us to bind events such as keystrokes to a function in the component file. When these events occur, the data is sent to that funciton. This is one-way from template -> component.
 - What is two-way binding? Describe the syntax and name the directive required
   - Combining property and event bindings, we use the "banana-in-a-box syntax with the ngModel directive to achieve two-way binding.
 - What is a template?
   - A template is the file containing html that describes what the component will look like (AKA the view)
 - What is a decorator?
   - A decorator is similar to a Java annotation, it is a function that is used to alter classes, methods, parameters, etc. It is used with @FunctionName syntax.
 - How does routing work in Angular?
   - Routing is used to hide or display components in the DOM view, and is analogous in SPA to navigating around different HTML pages. We have an element <router-outlet> which displays those components that we route to. We use the anchor tag `<a>` to dentote a route, but use the routerLink attribute in place of href.
 - Where does the ngModel directive come from?
   - Angular's FormsModule, which we import in order to use ngModel.
 - What makes a “single page application” (SPA) different from a normal web page?
   - A single page applicaiton is front-loaded, as in all of the components and data are loaded at once, and we don't need to invoke any more loads to get to different parts of our application. A traditional web site has different pages, and as we navigate around we request each page one at a time. In SPA instead of viewing different pages, we simply hide and show different components as needed.
 - What are the properties of the metadata object passed to the @Component decorator?
   - template - used to write the template (html) code inline
   - templateUrl - used to point to a file containing the template code (html)
   - selector - indicates the element that can be used to nest this component in another template
   - styleUrls - used to indicate the file containing CSS styling for this component
 - What are the properties of the metadata object passed to the @NgModule decorator?
   - declarations - describe which components will be used in this module
   - imports - describes other modules whose functionality should be exposed to this module and it's components
   - providers - describes services that will be available to this module and it's component
   - bootstrap - describes the components needed to load the app-level module and root component - part of the initial bootstrap process
 - How are components registered to an Angular module?
   - CLI command: `ng generate component <directive-name>` registers components in the @NgModule decorated object, in the declarations array
 - How are directives registered to an Angular module?
   - CLI command: `ng generate directive <directive-name>` which registers these in the declarations array of the @NgModule decorated object.
  - What are some features of the Angular framework?
   - Support for mobile displays as of Angular2+
   - CLI - which gives us commands to generate and modify the Angular project easily
   - Single page application support (including webpacking)
   - built-in testing support with Jasmine
   - animation features
   - Code generation - our template, components, modules, and other files are combined into views that are optimized for javascript virtual machines
   - Dependency Injection via injectors
 - How does TypeScript relate to JavaScript? What are the major benefits of using it over JavaScript?
   - TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which supports strict typing, classes, interfaces, and other OOP concepts that JS lacks.
   - Strong typing helps write better code, modern OOP features help write cleaner code
 - List the data types of TypeScript
   - Number, String, Boolean, Void, Null, Undefined, and user-defined types like enums, classes, arrays, etc.
 - How would you create a new Angular project?
   - CLI command: `ng new <project-name>`
 - Explain the relevance of npm to Angular projects. Which file does npm use to track dependencies?
   - npm is used to manage packages that Angular may need, including Angular itself. 
   - package.json is used to track dependencies
 - List some decorators for Angular apps
   - @Component, @Directive, @NgModule, @Decorator, @Pipe, @Service, @Injectable
 - What is the lifecycle of a component? List some lifecycle hooks
   - Instantiation, service(continuous detection of changes to data-bound properties and updating the DOM accordingly), destruction
   - constructor, ngOnChanges, ngOnInit, ngDoCheck, ngAfterContentInit, ngAfterContentChecked, ngAfterViewInit, ngAfterViewChecked, ngOnDestroy
 - What is a directive and what are the different types? How to tell these directives apart with syntax?
   - A directive is a class marked with the @Directive decorator, a directive is a class which applies behaviors to DOM elements.
   - Attribute directives which are written with square brackets like [NgClass]
   - Structural directives which are written with the \* like \*NgFor and \*NgIf
   - Component directives - components associated with an HTML template
 - What is the benefit of using a directive like NgClass over the class attribute, or even property binding to the class attribute?
   - NgClass directive can be used to apply multiple class-selectors to a DOM element. It can also apply selectors based on expressions for more robust logic.
 
 - What forms of data binding does Angular support? Explain the syntax for each
   - String interpolation - one-way data binding where data in the component is referenced by the template and often visible in the view. Syntax: {{ identifierName }}
   - Property binding - one-way data binding where data in the component is referenced by the template. Syntax: [identifierName]
   - Event binding - one-way data binding where data is sent from the template as an event to the component. Syntax: (eventName)="eventHandler()"
     - Two-way data binding can be achieved by combining property and event binding with banana-in-a-box syntax:  [(NgModel)]="value"
 - What does Webpack do for your ng project?
   - Packages angular modules into payloads that can be loaded at once, rather than loading scripts and assets separately. This front-loads the load times and reduces overhead.
